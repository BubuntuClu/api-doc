# Introduction

Welcome to the Pact API! You can use our API as a single messaging API.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

This API was designed by way `Implement only required`. Feel you free to contact with support if you are sure what make sense to append additional methods.

Part of the operations **can not** be performed synchronously, so you should be ready to accept `webhook`'s.
